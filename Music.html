				 Upstaged: Culture Night at the Park 

Fitzgerald’s Park, 4pm - 8.30pm 

One for all the family, Fitzgerald’s Park will present a series of short circus and street performance shows that have been specially programmed by the Circus Factory for Culture Night. The evening of circus, music and art will also feature Cork Puppetry Company and other local artists and creatives, and Fitzgerald’s Park is the focal point of the city’s Culture Night celebrations this year,
 so there will be lots to see and do in the area.
