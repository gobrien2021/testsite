			Circus Factory 

Town centre, Carrigaline, 4pm - 9pm

There’s no thrill like a circus being in town, and one is rolling up in Carrigaline for Culture Night. Circus Factory will bring the stories, colour and life of circus arts to the streets of the town, with performances throughout the day in different areas of Carrigaline. Among the highlights is Wobbly Circus, which will be in the area with a clown on a bike: 
they call it free-range circus with added bass.</p>

				Culture Night at the Milk Market 

Milk Market, Co Limerick, 4pm - 8pm

Limerick’s iconic Milk Market will feature music, food and fun for Culture Night in partnership with the Limerick Food Group. We’re not telling porkies when we say there are lots of events for families to take part in: events will include a display of the giant pig and recently commissioned family pig floats, and a pigtown mask-making demonstration. Elsewhere, food producer displays, close-up magic by illusionist Steve Spade, and music by the Downtown Dixie Band will entertain visitors while 
shops and stallholders will be open for the night.
